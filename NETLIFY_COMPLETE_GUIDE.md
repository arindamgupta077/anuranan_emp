## üéØ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Connect to Netlify

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
2. Click **"Add new site"** ‚Üí **"Import an existing project"**
3. Choose your Git provider (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
4. Authorize Netlify to access your repositories
5. Select the `anuranan_emp` repository

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings

Netlify should auto-detect settings from `netlify.toml`, but verify:

```
Base directory: frontend
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: frontend/.next
```

**Important:** These settings are already configured in `netlify.toml`, so Netlify should pick them up automatically.

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

In the Netlify dashboard, go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables** and add:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Anuranan Employee Portal
```

### Step 4: Deploy

1. Click **"Deploy site"**
2. Wait 3-5 minutes for the build to complete
3. Check build logs for any errors
4. Your site will be live at: `https://random-name-12345.netlify.app`

### Step 5: Test Deployment

Visit your site and test:
- [ ] Login page loads
- [ ] Can log in successfully
- [ ] Dashboard loads with data
- [ ] Navigation between pages works
- [ ] PWA features work (if enabled)
- [ ] Service worker registers correctly
- [ ] Page refreshes work (not 404)

## üîß Post-Deployment Configuration

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Domain management**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter your domain name
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions

### HTTPS/SSL

- Netlify automatically provisions SSL certificates
- Your site will be accessible via HTTPS
- HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS

### Enable Netlify Functions (If needed)

If you need serverless functions:
1. Create `netlify/functions` folder in your project root
2. Add function files (JavaScript/TypeScript)
3. Redeploy

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Issue:** Build fails with dependency errors
**Solution:** 
- Check if all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Clear build cache in Netlify (Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Clear cache and retry deploy)
- Check Node version compatibility (set to 18 in `netlify.toml`)

### 404 on Page Refresh

**Issue:** Refreshing non-home pages gives 404
**Solution:**
- Verify `_redirects` file exists in `frontend/public/`
- Verify `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` is installed
- Check `netlify.toml` has the plugin configured

### Environment Variables Not Working

**Issue:** App can't connect to Supabase
**Solution:**
- Verify all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are set in Netlify dashboard
- Redeploy after adding/changing environment variables
- Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Slow Build Times

**Issue:** Builds taking too long
**Solution:**
- Enable build plugins caching in `netlify.toml`
- Use `NETLIFY_USE_YARN=true` if you prefer Yarn
- Consider upgrading to paid plan for faster builds

### PWA Not Working

**Issue:** Service worker not registering
**Solution:**
- Check `next-pwa` configuration in `next.config.js`
- Verify `manifest.json` is in public folder
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA)
- Check browser console for errors
