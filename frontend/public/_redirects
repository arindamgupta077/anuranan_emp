# Netlify redirects for Next.js routing
# This file is handled by @netlify/plugin-nextjs
# The plugin automatically creates the correct redirects for Next.js pages

# If you have a separate backend API, uncomment and configure:
# /api/*  https://your-backend-api.onrender.com/api/:splat  200

# The @netlify/plugin-nextjs handles all routing automatically
# DO NOT add catch-all redirects here as they break Next.js SSR/SSG
